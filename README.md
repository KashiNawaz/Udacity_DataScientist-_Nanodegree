## Lessson: Introduction to Data Science 
Introduce the data science process and how to communicate results to stakeholders.

### Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post
In this project, you will choose a dataset, identify three questions, and analyze the data to find answers to these questions. You will create a github repository with your project, and write a blog post to communicate your findings to the appropriate audience. The project will help you reinforce and extend your knowledge of machine learning, data visualization, and communication.

## Lesson: Data Engineering for Data Scientists
Learn to work with data through the entire data science process, from running pipelines, transforming data, building models, and deploying solutions to the cloud.

### Project: Build Disaster Response Pipelines to Classify Messages
Figure Eight, a company focused on creating datasets for AI applications, has crowdsourced the tagging and translation of messages to improve disaster relief efforts. In this project, you’ll build a data pipeline to prepare message data from major natural disasters around the world. You’ll build a machine learning pipeline to categorize emergency messages based on the needs communicated by the sender.

## Lession: Experiment Design and Recommendations
Learn to design experiments and analyze A/B test results. Explore approaches for building recommendation systems.

### Project: Design a Recommendation Engine with IBM
IBM has an online data science community where members can post tutorials, notebooks, articles, and datasets. In this project, you will build a recommendation engine based on user behavior and social network data, to surface content most likely to be relevant to a user. You’ll work with IBM Watson and IBM Cloud to build and deploy the recommendation to a frontend application.

### Project: Data Science Capstone Project
We will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the program to build your own data science project. You will define the problem, identify and explore the data, perform your analyses, and present your solution in a blog post or frontend application. This project will serve as a demonstration of your ability as a Data Scientist, and will be an important piece of your job-ready portfolio.
