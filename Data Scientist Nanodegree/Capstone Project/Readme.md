# Capstone Project: Dog Breed Classifier

### Project Motivation
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in order to build a pipeline to process real-world images. CNNs are commonly used to analyse image data.I used Tranfer Learning, Transfer learning is a technique that allows to reuse a model across different tasks. The objective is that given an image of a human or dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the dog's breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. If the algorithm can't identify the image as a human or dog, it will say so.
