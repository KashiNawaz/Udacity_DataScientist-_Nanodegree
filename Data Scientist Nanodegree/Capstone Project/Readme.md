# Capstone Project: Sparkify Project

### Project Motivation
This project is a part of the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program analyzing the behaviour of users for an app called Sparkify and predict the customer churn. Sparkify dataset contains user behaviour log for the past few months. It contains some basic information about the users as well as information about a particular action they have taken since their registration. A user can have multiple actions which leads to multiple entries for a user, we can identify when a user churned through the action of account cancellation.
