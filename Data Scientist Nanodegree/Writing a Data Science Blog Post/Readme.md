### Project Motivation
I followed the CRISP-DM process to analyze the Seattle Airbnb homes data and answer the following three questions:

    Which areas are more mob and expensive ?
    How much prices spikes in the busiest time of the year ?
    Which features will be more helpful in predicting price in that area ?
### File Descriptions
 There is one Jupyter Notebook file which is about the analysis of Airbnb seattle homes data and it answers all the above three questions.
 In the data folder, it contains the data files of Airbnb Seattle homes. 
 
### Required Libraries/Installation
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Sklearn
These above libraries were required to be installed.

### Results
    1-prices increase in summer season and decrease in winter season.
    2-Magnolia, Queen Anne and Downtown are more expensive.
    3-Delridge, Northgate, Rainier Valley, and Lake City are cheaper.
    4-The number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the weekly cost of the listing, and the cost of cleaning service are the most important factor in determine listings price.
    5-December, March, and October are the busiest months of the year, while January, February and July are the least.
    6-Capitol Hill, Downtown, and Central Area are more crowded.
    Interbay, Seward Park, Magnolia, and Lake City are less crowded.
